TNT mod API

On load TNT mod will gather two settings from the minetest.conf file:

'enable_tnt' a boolean switch which defaults to enabled in singleplayer and disabled on mulitplayer
'tnt_radius' an integer which provides the blast radius of a TNT explosion (default: 3)


We also have some global functions which can be called by other mods so long as 'tnt' appears in their depends.txt file:

tnt.register_tnt(def)

  'name' name of tnt node to register
  'description' node description to appear in inventory
  'tiles' texture table for node
  'radius' size of damage area to inflict on surrounding nodes
  'damage_radius' size of area to inflice damage on surrounding entities (defaults to 2x radius)


tnt.burn(pos, nodename)

  'pos' position of node to burn/ignite
  'nodename' the name of the node to burn/ignite (can be nil as it will be gotten)


tnt.boom (pos, def)

  'pos' centre position of explosion
  'def' table definition containing explosion settings:
     'radius' radius of the explosion which explodes surrounding nodes
     'damage_radius' radius of explosion damage which causes harm to surrounding entities
     'ignore_protection' when true will explode protected areas (default: false)
     'disable_drops' when true will not drop node items (default: false)
     'explode_center' when true will apply on_boom and drops for center 'pos' node
     'sound' custom explosion sound (default: "tnt_boom")
